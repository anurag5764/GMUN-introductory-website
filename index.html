                <span>"Model United Nations is an academic simulation of the United Nations where students
                     play the role of delegates from different countries and attempt to solve real world 
                     issues with policies and perspectives of an assigned country. These are exercises beneficial
                      for those interested in learning more about the UN. They engage in negotiations, discussions
                       and lively debate over various agendas to come to a consensus with the other nations."
